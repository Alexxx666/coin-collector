# Coin Collector
Simple HTML Canvas game - written just for fun and as a learning project. The idea is not mine :(
It's a first working version and unlikely to be updated.
# Game rules
The goal is very simple - you have to collect 100 coins.
A new coin appear every 3 seconds.
For ten coins you can build a factory - it increases the amount of appearing coins by 1.
You can't have more than 5 factories. 
If you have 2 or more factories you can build a plant for 20 coins - it increases the amount of appearing coins by 2.
You can't have more than 5 plants.
The game ends when you collect 100 coins.
